# adaptive-pipeline-model

**Brief Project Context:** ...

**Purpose of this Repository:** Houses code for building the FFN (Feedforward Neural Network) models based on the configurations provided by the `adaptive-pipeline-config` module. 

**Key Technologies:**
*   Python
*   TensorFlow or PyTorch 
*   GCP AI Platform Notebooks (for development)
*   GCP AI Platform Training (potentially for scaling training)

**Getting Started**
...

**Usage/Examples**
*   **Inputs:**
    *   JSON configuration file generated by `adaptive-pipeline-config`
*   **Outputs:**
    *   A trained FFN model (potentially saved in a standard format like TensorFlow SavedModel).
